# Cancer-Prediction
To predict whether a tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B) based on the features of cell nuclei from a breast mass.

# Dataset
https://github.com/YBIFoundation/Dataset/raw/main/Cancer.csv

# Steps

Data Preprocessing (handled missing values, feature scaling)

Trained models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, SVM, Gradient Boosting

Evaluated with Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

# Results

Logistic Regression performed best (~97%)

# Conclusion

Machine learning models can accurately predict tumor types, helping healthcare professionals make faster and more reliable decisions.
